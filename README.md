## Assumptions

- Build a one page web application where data can be inputed to a maximum of 5 forms.
- Create features only described in the design spec and readme

## Next Steps

- Use redux to keep track of user data if this project were to get extended into a full web app
- Create more intuitive behaviour for form expansion when deleting a MUI expansion form.
- Implement tighter form validation. Eg: date is properly formatted or validating a real email
- More specific error message alert regarding missing required fields
- Add button animations for adding, sending, and deleting a form
- Create a more user friendly experience when using autocomplete to fill in address field

3. Cd into the root folder where package.json is located through the terminal.

4. Run: npm install (this will likely take some time)

5. Run: npm start

if an error occurs about a dependency not being installed. Run: npm install YOURDEPENDENCY
